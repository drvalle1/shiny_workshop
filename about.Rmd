# Dr. Denis Valle (drvalle@ufl.edu)

Denis is a quantitative scientist broadly interested in problems in developing countries and Bayesian models. His work has focused predominantly in developing next-generation models for highly multivariate biodiversity data (e.g., the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model), determining the impact of large-scale anthropogenic stressors in the Amazon region (e.g., using copula models to quantify the hydrological impact of large dams), and developing models and decision support tools for malaria epidemiology.

description: "Lyndsie suggests that we should actually flip the order of the first two activities. i.e., day 1 should be Denis's overview paired with decision theory and the story board/ app design activity. That way, all the high-level concepts are together and people can determine what they need to communicate before being presented with the menu of tools to acccomplish it."
